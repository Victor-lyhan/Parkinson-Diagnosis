For each HC and PD participant, we labeled the data regarding scores on the Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y), as well as the UPDRS II part 5 and UPDRS III part 18 scale. The voice recordings are labeled in the following scheme:

SI_ HS_ HYR_ UPDRS II-5_UPDRS III-18

with

SI as subject identification in the form IDNN, N in [0, 9]
HS as the health status label (hc or pd accordingly)
HYR as the expert assessed H&Y scale rating
UPDRS II-5 as the according expert peer-reviewed score
UPDRS III-18 as the according expert assessed score

For example, an audio recording with the file name “ID02_pd_1_2_1.wav” represents a recording of the third participant (First participant was anonymized as ID00), 
which has PD and a H&Y rating of 1, a UPDRS II-5 score of 2 and a UPDRS III-18 score of 1. At this point, it should be noted, 
that also all healthy controls were evaluated with regard to the introduced scales, because Parkinson's disease and voice degradation correlate, 
but don't match exactly. This means, that the data set includes one HC participant (ID31) with UPDRS II-5 and III-18 rating of 1, 
and also includes PD patients with UPDRS II-5 and III-18 ratings of 0. It should be emphasized, that this does not mean the data set includes ambiguous information, 
but that an expert was not able to hear voice degradation that would end up in a UPDRS rating greater than zero. Machine learning approaches may be able to nevertheless classify correctly,
 or at least learn to correlate, but not match PD and voice degradation at any time.
